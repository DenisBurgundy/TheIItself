## Personality

Never forgetting the gap of centuries that separates us from D. Denis, it is possible to trace an outline of the main lines of the personality of this Portuguese king. He was determined, or even obstinate, in his intentions, of which the "truly devastating cadence of inquiries" and other policies of royal centralization that he systematically instituted are an example.

Early on, he proved to be a great strategist, being a precursor of a government and legislative policy that was not only reactive but rather proactive. Benefiting from an a posteriori analysis, it is clear that decisions were not being taken at random, but were articulated in the path of an idea of country and nation that the King aspired to. By way of example, mention should be made of the concomitant creation of councils and fairs, border fortification policies, or the growing dependence of military orders on the royal power.
