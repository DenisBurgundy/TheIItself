## Personality

Never forgetting the gap of centuries that separates us from D. Denis, it is possible to trace an outline of the main lines of the personality of this Portuguese king. He was determined, or even obstinate, in his intentions, of which the "truly devastating cadence of inquiries" and other policies of royal centralization that he systematically instituted are an example.

Early on, he proved to be a great strategist, being a precursor of a government and legislative policy that was not only reactive but rather proactive. Benefiting from an a posteriori analysis, it is clear that decisions were not being taken at random, but were articulated in the path of an idea of country and nation that the King aspired to. By way of example, mention should be made of the concomitant creation of councils and fairs, border fortification policies, or the growing dependence of military orders on the royal power.

For all these reasons, D. Denis was recognized as a shrewd man of high government capacity, both by contemporaries and later historians. D. Denis did not lack what we now call political skill. Being skillful in dealing with and understanding of Men, D. Denis knew how to go "alternately attacking and appeasing the secular and ecclesiastical interests: he demortized the clergy's assets, but accepted the concordat and restricted the rights of the commissary in the monasteries; he inquired about the goods; seigneurial estates, but demortization laws curb the erosion of seigneurial patrimony". The administration of royal estates became more efficient and D. Denis became known as a wealthy king; of this, we find an echo in Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy.

Nevertheless, D. Denis is most celebrated in all contemporary and later chronicle records as a just King. Knowing that most of the legislative work of his reign was focused on issues of procedural justice, it is no less important than much of this new legislation goes towards avoiding excessive delays and court costs and preventing abuse of lawyers and attorneys.

It can also be said of him that the determination that so many political achievements gained him could, at times, degenerate into stubbornness and arrogance. Described at times as cruel, especially in family relationships: in the way he treated his heir son D. Afonso (never his favorite) and his wife D. Isabel, giving him the fruits of their adulteries so that he could raise them.
An inescapable figure on the Iberian Peninsula at the end of the 200s and the beginning of the 300s, D. Denis was called Pai-da-Pátria by Duarte Nunes de Leão.
